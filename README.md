# LOGSEQ-CLIPPER

Logseq-clipper is a web clipper that allows you to select text from a webpage and transform it into a Logseq Markdown Block that you can add to your Logseq Graph. Logseq-Clipper creates two types of LogSeq blocks: a generic block and a to-do block.

## How to use

### Generic Block

If you want to clip some text from a specific webpage, you visit the webpage and press CTRL+SHIFT+U (to create a new generic clipping). You will see a popup appearing containing the current clipping. 

Next, you can add text to the current clipping by making a new text selection and pressing CTRL+SHIFT+U again. The newly selected text will be added to the clipping. Continue until you have clipped all the text you want.

If necessary, you can also manualy make changes in your clipping by editing the text in the popup (which contains a textarea).

Once you are satisfied with your clipping, you press CTRL+SHIFT+I to close the popup and copy the clipping to your clipboard.

### TODO Block

To create a TODO block, you do exactly the same as with a Generic block, but you should use CTRL+SHIFT+Y to create a TODO clipping and to add text to your TODO clipping. To close the popup and copy your block to your clipboard, you press CTRL+SHIFT+I again.
